# This can be a filesystem directory, or a remote url such as http or ftp. These
# would contain the sstate-cache results from previous builds (possibly from other 
# machines). This variable works like fetcher MIRRORS/PREMIRRORS and points to the 
# cache locations to check for the shared objects.
